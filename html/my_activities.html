                My name is SEFINEH TESFA. I am a 3rd year software engineering student at Addis Ababa Institute of Technology.<br>
                I am now studying at Addis Ababa University. In this section I will tell you my student level activities.<br>
                My activities at this moment are many more, but I will show you the most important activiteis I already participated.<br>
                Among my activities, the first one is A2SV Internship Training. This training aims to give opportunities for students<br>
                who have a talent, but they didn't get the good opportunities. The internship training connects students, who have a talent,<br>  
                to the top Tech companies for better opportunities. I am among those lucky students. The program has a summer internship program.<br>
                The internship is to top Tech companies.The leader for the team now is Emre. He is a smart guy who has a passion to help talented <br>
                students who needs better opportunities.The second one is MSD 101 training. The MSD 101 stands for Marketable Software Development 101.<br>
                The leader was Hiruy who is a talent and one of the members of the founders of Icogs Lab Company. The training is lead by IMakers.<br>
                IMakers are collaborated with International Trade Center Company. IMakers are the members of Icog Labs Company at this level.<br> 
                I certified from this training by International Trade Center company.<br>
                I participated in the Hackathons of MSD 101 training. The Management Consultant, Sophie gave us a Digital <br>Business Building training.
                The main focus was Prototype Building and Designing a Software product after analysizing the problems.<br>
