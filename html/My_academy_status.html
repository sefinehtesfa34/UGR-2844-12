                <p>This is my pleasure to share you my experiences and 
                my backgrounds related to my education 
                systems from level one up to now (December 2021).
                First I am super excited to tell you my backgrounds.
                 Now let me show you from the beginning of my education systems up to now.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p> I was 7 years old when I came to school for the first time. 
                My father is a farmer who is very very hard working man. However, 
                It is not ideal to say that he is like a proficient at that 
                level befor 15 years. He is very wise. My dad was one of 
                the bearocrates in the regime of Derg.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div><p>A bureaucrat is a member of a bureaucracy and can compose 
                the administration of any organization of any size. 
                He was teaching and administering a large goups of people.
                He brought me in a fantastic way as he advised me a lot.
                 I don't have sound to say what he was doing for me. 
                 At the first time my dad invited me to Hamus Wenz primary school.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Hamus Wenz primary school is located in amhara region at sekela wereda. 
                    More specifically it is located at Taliya kebele.
                The primary school was up to grade 8 levels. In my ministery 
                regional exam I had got 92 percentiles which was 72 out of 100.
                </p>
            </div>
                <div><p>From grade 9 to grade 12, I was the first in my sections all of the semesters.
                     In the first semester, one student leveled above me but I leveled above him in the next semester and
                    then in CGPA, I was the first. In matrices, I have got 4 that was fantastic for my families. 
                    They felt that I would be among the top rank students.
                    </p>
                </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>However, with is a short period of time their thought was real and achieved. 
                            I was the first in my secondary school grade 12 Entrance National Exam.
                        I have got 611 out of 700. I have got a reward from the regional government. 
                        I recieved the reward in Bahir Dar, the capital of Amhara region.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>The specific place I recieved the reward was at GROUND HOTEL, 
                            near Lake Tana. The reward was 5000 birr from the regional government 
                            and personal computer from ASRAT Non-governmental Organization.
                            Unfortunately, I didn't recieve the personal computer as that 
                            was limited relative to the number of students. But,I recieved my money reward.
                        </p>
